  - Ender Eye
  - Gold Ingot
- Blaze Rods, Blaze Powder, Ender Pearls and Ender Eyes don't get cleared from your inventory after a reroll
  - You also have four available slots to store **only** these four items
- You can use your offhand and another slot on the left side of your inventory to save items
- You can equip armor items without losing it
- The rest of your inventory is **locked**
