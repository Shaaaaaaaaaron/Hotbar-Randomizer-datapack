# Hotbar-Randomizer-datapack

A challenge datapack for Minecraft that randomizes your hotbar.


## **About**
- Every 10 seconds your hotbar will be rerolled with completely random items
- Items can get random enchantments
- When a reroll happens, every item from the ground is cleared. Exceptions:
  - Blaze Rod
  - Blaze Powder
  - Ender Pearl
  - Ender Eye
  - Gold Ingot
- Blaze Rods, Blaze Powder, Ender Pearls and Ender Eyes don't get cleared from your inventory after a reroll
  - You also have four available slots to store **only** these four items
- You can use your offhand and another slot on the left side of your inventory to save items
- The rest of your inventory is **locked**
